# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performed analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, is uncertain about starting a crowdfunding campaign for her play "Fever." She has asked for help to ensure she has a good fundraiser. In this module, I analyzed data using Excel tools to understand and compare patterns between successful and failed campaigns, and provide this information to set Louise up for success.

##Analysis and Challenges
###To start off this project I downloaded the data file containing all the raw data regarding Kickstarter campaigns. There were thousands of cells full of information so the first step was separating and color coding data, finding out dates, and cleaning up the spreadsheet overall. Next I used several formulas to find the important features such as the funding goals, outcomes, and campaigning dates. Once this was done, it was easy to calculate and manipulate the data to find out the best time of the year to campaign and what Louise's funding goal should be. A big challenge for this project is that it required handling a large amount of raw data, and as the first challenge, getting familiar with it and learning to think like an analyst. The next challenges I encountered were simple typing mistakes when entering formulas into Excel, but otherwise I did not have any other issues completing this analysis.
