# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performed analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, is uncertain about starting a crowdfunding campaign for her play "Fever." She has asked for help to ensure she has a good fundraiser. In this module, I analyzed data using Excel tools to understand and compare patterns between successful and failed campaigns, and provide this information to set Louise up for success.
## Analysis and Challenges
### To start off this project I downloaded the data file containing all the raw data regarding Kickstarter campaigns. There were thousands of cells full of information so the first step was separating and color coding data, finding out dates, and cleaning up the spreadsheet overall. Next I used several formulas to find the important features such as the funding goals, outcomes, and campaigning dates. Once this was done, it was easy to manipulate the data with a PivotTable to find out the best time of the year to campaign by creating a line chart comparing successful plays and monthly launch dates.

### To analyze what Louise's funding goal should be I was able to use the same spreadsheet as before, but I needed to make another calculation using the percentage of successful, failed and canceled projects along with the goal amounts for each. With this information tabulated, I created the below chart showing the outcomes of these projects.

### A big challenge for this project is that it required handling a large amount of raw data, and as the first course project, getting familiar with it and learning to think like an analyst. Using PivotTables and Charts is nothing new to me, but knowing what fields to choose for the rows and columns made me unsure at times. The next challenges I encountered were simple typing mistakes when entering formulas into Excel, but I am experienced with the program and most of the functions used so I did not have any other issues completing this analysis. 
## Results
- As seen on the first chart, the most successful months for launching a campaign were May and June so planning to start around those months would be a great decision. Additionally, the campaigns that started toward the beginning and of the year were more likely to fail. 
- Now looking at the chart comparing goals, the campaigns that aimed to collect $15,000 or less proved to be at least 50% successful with lower goals showing greater success. Based on this data Louise could keep her goal of $10,000 and will have a good chance of success. 
- Although this dataset provides a lot of valuable information, there are a few downsides to it considering there is so much data in it that some of it may not be useful such as the different categories of campaigns or the country where it was launched. 
- Another graph that could be created for this analysis would be a stacked bar graph to show the outcome results based on the launch date like the one shown below. This could be very useful in showing the total campaigns per month and the outcomes of each month are easier to see instead of the peaks of a line chart.![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88118759/131177116-fe249ae7-666a-4a1e-a154-bc2c3d0d9751.png)
